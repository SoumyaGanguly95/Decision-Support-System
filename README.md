# Decision-Support-System
Decision support system using deeplearning
The following Convolution Neural Network aims at providing accurate results even with getting trained with small datasets[for e.g with 30 images per label].
The project was performed to design an efficient power consumption system with images captured from cctv footages. 
The problem is an example of an image classification problem. The dataset comprises of 3 datasets.
[1] Label 1: Power on and people present in the room.[Ideal Situation]
[2] Label 2: Power on and room empty.[Non- ideal situation]
[3] Label 3: power off and room empty.[Ideal Situation]

The cnn designed identifies the exact scenario from images tested at that instant and detects any anamolous situation corresponding to label 2 images.
